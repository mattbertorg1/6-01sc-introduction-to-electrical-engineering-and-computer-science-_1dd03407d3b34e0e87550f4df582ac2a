Session Overview
----------------

| ![Image of the Towers of Hanoi puzzle.](/coursemedia/6-01sc-introduction-to-electrical-engineering-and-computer-science-i-spring-2011/876348cfc054d115079945d3f42fedea_2.jpg) |  {{< br >}}{{< br >}} In this session, we expand on programming, introducing other programming paradigms and indicating features of Python that tie in to notable programming concepts. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} We also introduce state machines. State machines model systems that are functional, but also have memory. State machines are incredibly general, but incredibly powerful, and can be used to model all kinds of systems, as you'll see in future sessions. You can use state machines to control, model, and predict behaviors in systems. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} The overview handout provides a more detailed introduction, including the big ideas of the session, key vocabulary, and what you should understand (theory) and be able to do (practice) after completing this session. {{< br >}}{{< br >}} *   [Session 2 Handout: State Machines (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/unit-1-software-engineering/state-machines/mit6_01scs11_ses02) {{< br >}}{{< br >}}  

Session Content
---------------

### Readings

Read chapter 4 of the course notes.

*   [Chapter 4: State Machines (PDF)]({{< baseurl >}}/sections/unit-1-software-engineering/state-machines/mit6_01scs11_chap04)

### Lecture Video

Watch the lecture video. The handout and slides present the same material, but the slides include answers to the in-class questions.

> ### About this Video
> 
> Discussion of imperative, functional, and object-oriented programming styles. State machines are introduced, using a turnstile as an example.
